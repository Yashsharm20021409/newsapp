<!-- 
class Based component is simple to use first create new class which is extended an existing class called component
1. export default class means export this for index.js to insert app.js in html file using index.js 

difference 
as you can here we simply return a function(render func) inside the class but in function based we directly return the function
but this is not the main diff (the main diffrenece is in state and props and you can create sevral method )
->we can create sevral variable without let,const.. and use them insde the class like {this.varName} and inside state aslo

// render is a life cycle method(jb react ek component ko load krti h to kuch series of method run hote h) 
// jb render mthod run hote h to screen pe html ko(phle jsx ko html me compile krna then render krna) render krna
